#### Good day! I am a second year UBC BCom student intending to specialize in finance with a possible second specialization in accounting. Having immigrated to Vancouver 10 years ago from Asia, I grew up learning to keep an open mind and speaking two languages, and am now working on Japanese and French.  

####My personal webpage is unfortunately still under construction, but it will be up in the next week. For now, for an informal list of my hobbies and interests, please scroll down!
